# Bit Manipulation Problems

This folder contains solutions to problems related to bit manipulation.

Bit manipulation problems often involve performing operations directly on the binary representation of numbers. Solutions may include techniques for setting, flipping, and checking specific bits.

### Solved Problems:
**[476_Number_Complement](476_EASY_Number_Complement.js)** - An easy bit flip solution  
**[1009_Complement_of_Base_10_Integer](1009_EASY_Complement_of_Base_10_Integer.js)** - Same problem as before but with a few different implementations  

### Key Concepts:
- **Bitwise Operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)**
- **Shifting (Left Shift, Right Shift)**
- **Masking**
- **Counting Bits**
- **Parity Checks**
- **Bitwise Tricks and Techniques**
