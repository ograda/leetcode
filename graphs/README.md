# Graph Problems

This folder contains solutions to problems related to graph data structures.

Graph problems often involve exploring nodes and edges, finding paths, and understanding the connections between elements. Solutions may include breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), and algorithms for shortest paths and connectivity.

### Solved Problems:
**[997_Find_the_own_Judge](997_EASY_Find_the_own_Judge.js)** - originally tought as a graphs approach but a simple hash map should be enough  

### Key Concepts:
- **Graph Traversals (BFS, DFS)**
- **Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)**
- **Connectivity (Connected Components, Strongly Connected Components)**
- **Topological Sorting**
- **Graph Representation (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)**
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal, Prim)**
