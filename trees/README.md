# Tree Problems

This folder contains solutions to problems related to tree data structures.

Tree problems often involve traversals, recursive algorithms, and manipulation of hierarchical data. Solutions may include binary trees, binary search trees, and more complex tree structures.

### Solved Problems:
**[100_Same_Tree](100_EASY_Same_Tree.py)** - A tree traversal solution to check if two binary trees are the same.  
**[703_Kth_Largest_Element_in_a_Stream](703_EASY_Kth_Largest_Element_in_a_Stream.java)** - a priority queue to find the kth largest number on a stream  
**[145_Binary_Tree_Postorder_Traversal](trees/145_EASY_Binary_Tree_Postorder_Traversal.go)** - return the inversal order of a tree  
**[590_N-ary_Tree_Postorder_Traversal](trees/590_EASY_N-ary_Tree_Postorder_Traversal.go)** - a slightly different from the last problem, now the tree has different implementation  
**[94_Binary_Tree_Inorder_Traversal](trees/94_EASY_Binary_Tree_Inorder_Traversal.go)** - An approach that takes some from both before  

### Key Concepts:
- **Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)**
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**
- **Recursive Solutions**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**
