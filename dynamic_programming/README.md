# Dynamic Programming

This folder contains solutions to problems related to dynamic programming. 

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

### Solved Problems:
 **[070_Climbing_Stairs](070_EASY_Climbing_Stairs.ts)** - A basic math and dinamic programing problem, fibbonaci  
 **[931_Minimum_Falling_Path_Sum](931_MEDIUM_Minimum_Falling_Path_Sum.go)** - a Dinammic programming implemented backwards, with no recursion  
 **[1937_Maximum_Number_of_Points_with_Cost](dynamic_programming/1937_MEDIUM_Maximum_Number_of_Points_with_Cost.go)** - To leave the o(n^3) we have to do a two comparison temp arrays**[1140_Stone_Game_II](1140_MEDIUM_Stone_Game_II.cpp)** - a dinammic programming solution for to come up the best way a game can be played instead of bruteforcing  
 **[877_Stone_Game](877_MEDIUM_Stone_Game.cpp)** - a slight alteration on the last solution  
 **[1690_Stone_Game_VII](1690_MEDIUM_Stone_Game_VII.cpp)** - A bit more complex implementation of the last algorithm  
 **[664_Strange_Printer](664_HARD_Strange_Printer.java)** - a dinammic programming solution for a substring problem, tried the greed approach but it wasnt enough for the edge cases   

### Key Concepts:
- **Memoization**
- **Tabulation**
- **State Transition**
