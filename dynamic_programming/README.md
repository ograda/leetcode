# Dynamic Programming

This folder contains solutions to problems related to dynamic programming. 

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

### Solved Problems:
 **[070_Climbing_Stairs](070_EASY_Climbing_Stairs.ts)** - A basic math and dinamic programing problem, fibbonaci
 **[931_Minimum_Falling_Path_Sum](931_MEDIUM_Minimum_Falling_Path_Sum.go)** - a Dinammic programming implemented backwards, with no recursion
 **[1937_Maximum_Number_of_Points_with_Cost](dynamic_programming/1937_MEDIUM_Maximum_Number_of_Points_with_Cost.go)** - To leave the o(n^3) we have to do a two comparison temp arrays 

### Key Concepts:
- **Memoization**
- **Tabulation**
- **State Transition**
