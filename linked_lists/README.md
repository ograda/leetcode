# Linked List Problems

This folder contains solutions to problems related to linked lists.

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure where elements are stored in nodes, with each node pointing to the next one in the sequence. Linked list problems often involve traversal, manipulation, and understanding of node pointers.

### Solved Problems:
**[2_Add_Two_Numbers](linked_lists/2_EASY_Add_Two_Numbers.rs)** - A traveling trough linked lists creating a new list, Note that the hard part is the problem boundaries 

### Key Concepts:
- **Traversal** - Iterating through nodes to access or modify data.
- **Two-pointer Technique** - Using two pointers to solve problems like finding the middle of a list or detecting cycles.
- **Reversal** - Reversing the order of nodes in a linked list.
- **Cycle Detection** - Identifying cycles in a linked list using algorithms like Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare.
- **Merging** - Combining two or more linked lists into one.
