# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository.  
Here, Iâ€™m committed to solving 3 problems daily across various programming languages.  
I will try to balance the langage choosen to work on said language on a daily basis (IE monday will always be c++, tuesday will always be python.. etc)  
Have in mind, some of this languages were never used by myself and i am relying purely on my algorithm knowledge to come up to the solutions, and i will always try to avoid using
libraries when i can.  
I will also try to documment the code and write what is being done on every step.

## Repository Structure

- `dynamic_programming/`: Solutions related to dynamic programming problems.
- `arrays/`: Solutions related to array problems.
- `strings/`: Solutions related to string manipulation problems.
- Additional folders will be added as I solve more problems in other categories.

## Progress Tracking

You can track my daily progress in the [progress.md](progress.md) file.

## How to Use

Each folder contains the solution files categorized by problem type.  
The file names include the problem number, title, and difficulty level (e.g., `053_easy_maximum_subarray.py`).

## Languages Used

- **Python** (Monday)
- **C++** (Tuesday)
- **Java** (wednesday)
- **TypeScript** (Thursday)
- **JavaScript** (Friday)
- **Go** (Saturday)
- **Rust** (Sunday)
